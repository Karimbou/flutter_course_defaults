# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter. 


## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.

## What you will learn

- How to use Flutter themes to create coherent branding. 
- How to create multi-page apps using Flutter Routes and Navigator.
- How to extract and refactor Flutter Widgets with a click of the button. 
- How to pass functions as parameters and fields.
- How to use the GestureDetector Widget to detect more than just a tap.
- How to use custom colour palettes by using hex codes.
- How to customise Flutter Widgets to achieve a specific design style.
- Understand Dart Enums and the Ternary Operator.
- Learn about composition vs. inheritance and the Flutter way of creating custom UI.
- Understand the difference between const and final in Dart and when to use each.

## Material 3
"As of the Flutter 3.16 release, Material 3 is Flutter's default theme.
If you don't specify a theme in the constructor, Flutter creates a default theme for you."
https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes 

It is a bit more complex to control the colours etc of Material 3. I added some comments for us to find the propertiies which we need to change. 

To learn more about Material 3, check out the official Material 3 documentation.
https://m3.material.io/develop/flutter

Also I solved some Problems where the actual Flutter is a bit more acurate with Nullity and Functions.
