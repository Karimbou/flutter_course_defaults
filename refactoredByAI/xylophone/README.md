## The Code was refacored by Claude 3.5 Sonet

I let Claude at the feature that the app plays the sound whenever you press button.

#Claude added InkWell 
InkWell is a Material Design widget in Flutter that creates a rectangular area that responds to touch interactions with a ripple effect animation (ink splash). It's commonly used for the following purposes:

Touch Feedback: It provides visual feedback when users tap on an area by showing a material ink splash animation, which is consistent with Material Design guidelines.

Touch Handling: It handles various touch events like:

onTap
onDoubleTap
onLongPress
onTapDown
onTapCancel
onHover (for web/desktop)

Advantages over GestureDetector:

InkWell provides the visual ripple effect, while GestureDetector doesn't
It's more consistent with Material Design
Better accessibility support
