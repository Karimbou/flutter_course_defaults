 This repo is meant to help us students with the outdated flutter and flutter recources from the AppBrewery's (https://appbrewery.com/)
 excellent course flutter bootcamp with dart.

 I have updated the code to use the actual version of Flutter (pubspec.yaml) and Widgets (like TextButton instead of FlatButton). 
 As I use VS Code all files are optimied for this IDE.
 For those who wants to expeeriment you can also create an WebApp and an MacApp with the code now. 

Please feel free to colaborate with me in this project if you want to.
